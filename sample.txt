European leaders faced a dilemma Monday about whether to back down against a resounding Greek rejection of their austerity demands, amid signs that Greece was preparing a more conciliatory bid for a financial rescue just days before its banks face collapse.

All eyes were on a European Union conclave on Tuesday that promised to be a decisive moment for Greece, whose banks risk running run out of cash within days. The pressure intensified after the European Central Bank decided Monday not to expand its life support for the Greek banks, raising the prospect that they could be bankrupt by Wednesday absent an ECB reversal. That could force Greece off the euro, the common currency of 19 of the European Unions 28 member states.

Europe's decisions about how to respond to Sundays Greek referendum, which turned down Europe's exacting bailout terms, will determine far more than the fate of the flailing Mediterranean nation. Other euro-zone countries with shaky finances, such as Spain and Portugal, are watching whether Europe backs down on its tough economic demands in the face of domestic rebellions. That would spark new pressures in those nations. And if Greece is kicked off the euro, the ensuing turmoil might lead to moves in other nations to quit the currency club.

E.U. leaders said Monday that they awaited Greeces new bailout proposals, cracking the door ajar to a compromise despite vows last week that if Greeks rejected Europe's terms, there would be no further discussion.
